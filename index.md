# Edinburgh (MD) Simulation Day 8th May 2017

## Description

The aim of the Edinburgh (MD) Simulation Day is to bring together practitioners of molecular dynamics simulations and beyond at the University of Edinburgh across different Schools in the College of Science as well as other universities in Edinburgh.   
If you have ever considered any of the following questions:   

*  Are there other researchers in Edinburgh using similar simulation techniques to me and if so what kind of scientific questions do they try to address?
*  Could I learn from researchers in other Schools how to address certain problems that require (MD) simulations?
*  What kind of (MD) simulation based research goes on in other schools?
*  I am looking for new collaboration that will involve (MD) simulations within the University of Edinburgh. 

Then, this meeting it is probably for your. The idea is to give an overview of what research in the area of simulations is carried out at the University of Edinburgh and facilitate future collaborations across the different schools. 

This event has been supported with an IAD New Network Award.

## Registration

## FAQ

**Q:** I don't do molecular dynamics simulations but other kinds of simulations, is this meeting still for me?   
**A:** Yes, absolutely. Maybe this way new collaborations could even be formed.
